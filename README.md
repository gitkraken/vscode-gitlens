# GitLens

[GitLens](https://gitlens.amod.io 'Learn more about GitLens') is an [open-source](https://github.com/eamodio/vscode-gitlens 'Open GitLens on GitHub') extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) created, developed, and maintained by [Eric Amodio](https://www.amod.io 'Learn more about Eric').

GitLens simply helps you **better understand code**. Quickly glimpse into whom, why, and when a line or code block was changed. Jump back through history to **gain further insights** as to how and why the code evolved. Effortlessly explore the history and evolution of a codebase.

GitLens is **powerful**, **feature rich**, and [highly customizable](#gitlens-settings- 'Jump to the GitLens settings docs') to meet your needs. Do you find code lens intrusive or the current line blame annotation distracting &mdash; no problem, quickly turn them off or change how they behave via the interactive [_GitLens Settings_ editor](#configuration 'Jump to Configuration'). For advanced customizations, refer to the [GitLens docs](#gitlens-settings- 'Jump to GitLens settings') and edit your [user settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings 'Open User settings').
