# GitLens &mdash; Supercharge Git in VS Code

> Supercharge Git and unlock **untapped knowledge** within your repository to better **understand**, **write**, and **review** code. Focus, collaborate, accelerate.

[GitLens](https://gitkraken.com/gitlens?utm_source=gitlens-extension&utm_medium=in-app-links&utm_campaign=gitlens-logo-links 'Learn more about GitLens') is a powerful [open-source](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens 'Open GitLens on GitHub') extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

GitLens supercharges your Git experience in VS Code. Maintaining focus is critical, extra time spent context switching or missing context disrupts your flow. GitLens is the ultimate tool for making Git work for you, designed to improve focus, productivity, and collaboration with a powerful set of tools to help you and your team better understand, write, and review code.

GitLens sets itself apart from other Git tools through its deep level of integration, versatility, and ease of use. GitLens sits directly within your editor, reducing context switching and promoting a more efficient workflow. We know Git is hard and strive to make it as easy as possible while also going beyond the basics with rich visualizations and step-by-step guidance and safety, just to name a few.

### Inline and Status Bar Blame

Provides historical context about line changes through unobtrusive **blame annotation** at the end of the current line and on the status bar.

<figure align="center">

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/status-bar.png" alt="Status Bar Blame" />
  <figcaption>Status bar blame annotations</figcaption>
</figure>

üí° Use the `Toggle Line Blame` and `Toggle Git CodeLens` commands from the Command Palette to turn the annotations on and off.

### Git CodeLens

Adds contextual and actionable authorship information at the top of each file and at the beginning of each block of code.

- **Recent Change** &mdash; author and date of the most recent commit for the file or code block

Context switching kills productivity. GitLens not only reveals buried knowledge within your repository, it also brings additional context from issues and pull requests providing you with a wealth of information and insights at your fingertips.

Simplify your workflow and quickly gain insights with automatic linking of issues and pull requests across multiple Git hosting services including GitHub, GitHub Enterprise ‚ú®, GitLab, GitLab self-managed ‚ú®, Gitea, Gerrit, Google Source, Bitbucket, Bitbucket Server, Azure DevOps, and custom servers.

All integration provide automatic linking, while rich integrations with GitHub & GitLab offer detailed hover information for autolinks, and correlations between pull requests, branches, and commits, as well as user avatars for added context.

## Define your own autolinks

Use autolinks to linkify external references, like Jira issues or Zendesk tickets, in commit messages.

# GitKraken Labs

Our incubator for experimentation and exploration with the community to gather early reactions and feedback. Below are some of our current experiments.

## üß™AI Explain Commit
