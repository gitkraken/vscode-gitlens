# GitLens

[GitLens](https://gitkraken.com/gitlens?utm_source=gitlens-extension&utm_medium=in-app-links&utm_campaign=gitlens-logo-links 'Learn more about GitLens') is an [open-source](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens 'Open GitLens on GitHub') extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

GitLens simply helps you **better understand code**. Quickly glimpse into whom, why, and when a line or code block was changed. Jump back through history to **gain further insights** as to how and why the code evolved. Effortlessly explore the history and evolution of a codebase.

GitLens is **powerful**, **feature rich**, and [highly customizable](#gitlens-settings- 'Jump to the GitLens settings docs') to meet your needs. Do you find CodeLens intrusive or the current line blame annotation distracting &mdash; no problem, quickly turn them off or change how they behave via the interactive [_GitLens Settings_ editor](#configuration 'Jump to Configuration'). For advanced customizations, refer to the [GitLens docs](#gitlens-settings- 'Jump to GitLens settings') and edit your [user settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings 'Open User settings').

Here are just some of the **features** that GitLens provides,

# GitLens+ Features [#](#gitlens+-features- 'GitLens+ Features')

All-new, powerful, additional features that enhance your GitLens experience.

[GitLens+ features](https://gitkraken.com/gitlens/plus-features?utm_source=gitlens-extension&utm_medium=in-app-links&utm_campaign=gitlens-plus-links) are free for local and public repos, no account required, while upgrading to GitLens Pro gives you access on private repos.

> All other GitLens features can always be used on any repo.

## Does this affect existing features?

No, the introduction of GitLens+ features has no impact on existing GitLens features, so you won't lose access to any of the GitLens features you know and love. In fact, we are heavily investing in enhancing and expanding the GitLens feature set. Additionally, GitLens+ features are freely available to everyone for local and public repos, while upgrading to GitLens Pro gives you access on private repos.

## Commit Graph [#](#commit-graph- 'Commit Graph')

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/commit-graph-illustrated.png" alt="Commit Graph" />
</p>

The _Commit Graph_ helps you easily visualize and keep track of all work in progress. Not only does it help you verify your changes, but also easily see changes made by others and when. Selecting a row within the graph will open in-depth information about a commit or stash in the new [Commit Details view](#commit-details-view-).

Use the rich commit search to find exactly what you're looking for. It's powerful filters allow you to search by a specific commit, message, author, a changed file or files, or even a specific code change.

## Visual File History view [#](#visual-file-history-view- 'Visual File History view')

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/visual-file-history-illustrated.png" alt="Visual File History view" />
</p>

The _Visual File History_ view allows you to quickly see the evolution of a file, including when changes were made, how large they were, and who made them.

Use it to quickly find when the most impactful changes were made to a file or who best to talk to about file changes and more.

Authors who have contributed changes to the file are on the left y-axis to create a swim-lane of their commits over time (the x-axis). Commit are plotted as color-coded (per-author) bubbles, whose size represents the relative magnitude of the changes.

Additionally, each commit's additions and deletions are visualized as color-coded, stacked, vertical bars, whose height represents the number of affected lines (right y-axis). Added lines are shown in green, while deleted lines are red.

## Worktrees view [#](#worktrees-view- 'Worktrees view')

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/main/images/docs/worktrees-illustrated.png" alt="Worktrees view" />
</p>

Worktrees help you multitask by minimizing the context switching between branches, allowing you to easily work on different branches of a repository simultaneously.

Avoid interrupting your work in progress when needing to review a pull request. Simply create a new worktree and open it in a new VS Code window, all without impacting your other work.

You can create multiple working trees, each of which can be opened in individual windows or all together in a single workspace.

| `gitlens.currentLine.format`                   | Specifies the format of the current line blame annotation. See [_Commit Tokens_](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/wiki/Custom-Formatting#commit-tokens) in the GitLens docs. Date formatting is controlled by the `gitlens.currentLine.dateFormat` setting                                                                                                                                             |

See [_Commit Tokens_](https://github.com/gitkraken/vscode-gitlens/wiki/Custom-Formatting#commit-tokens) in the GitLens docs. Date formatting is controlled by the `gitlens.currentLine.dateFormat` setting<br/><br/>**NOTE**: Setting this to an empty string will disable current line blame annotations for uncommitted changes. |
| `gitlens.currentLine.pullRequests.enabled`     | Specifies whether to provide information about the Pull Request (if any) that introduced the commit in the current line blame annotation. Requires a connection to a supported remote service (e.g. GitHub)                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `gitlens.currentLine.scrollable`               | Specifies whether the current line blame annotation can be scrolled into view when it is outside the viewport. **NOTE**: Setting this to `false` will inhibit the hovers from showing over the annotation; Set `gitlens.hovers.currentLine.over` to `line` to enable the hovers to show anywhere over the line.                                                                                                   |
