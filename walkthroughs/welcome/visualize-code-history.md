## The commit graph

- Unlike VS Code’s read-only commit graph, the GitLens Commit Graph is fully interactive and includes features such as commit search, detailed history tracking, and the ability to explore file changes interactively.
- Manage version control right from your Commit Graph to reduce context switching and gain deeper insights into you and your team’s repository evolution.
