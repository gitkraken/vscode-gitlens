Worktrees help you multitask by minimizing the context switching between branches, allowing you to easily work on different branches of a repository simultaneously.

Avoid interrupting your work in progress when needing to review a pull request. Simply create a new worktree and open it in a new VS Code window, all without impacting your other work.

You can create multiple working trees, each of which can be opened in individual windows or all together in a single workspace.

_Note: Worktrees do not yet work with VS Code on the Web._
