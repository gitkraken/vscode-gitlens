## Does this affect existing features?

No, the introduction of GitLens+ features has no impact on existing GitLens features, so you won't lose access to any of the GitLens features you know and love. In fact, we are heavily investing in enhancing and expanding the GitLens feature set. Additionally, GitLens+ features are freely available to everyone for local and public repos, while upgrading to GitLens Pro gives you access on private repos.
