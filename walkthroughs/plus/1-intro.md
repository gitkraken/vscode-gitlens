## Introducing GitLens+

GitLens+ adds all-new, completely optional, features that enhance your current GitLens experience. These features are free for local and public repos, no account required.

â“˜ All other GitLens features are always accessible, without an account, and will continue to evolve and be invested in.

## Does this affect existing features?

No, the introduction of GitLens+ has no impact on existing GitLens features, so you won't lose access to any of the GitLens features you know and love. In fact, we are heavily investing in enhancing and expanding the GitLens feature set. Upgrading to GitLens Pro gives you access to GitLens+ features on private repos.
