 *
 * Three deliberate divergences from `Shape<AgentSession>`:
 *  - **`subagents` → `subagentCount`** — only the count badge consumes them today. Sending the
 *    recursive subagent tree (each with its own pendingPermission/lastPrompt) would bloat every
 *    snapshot push for a UI that doesn't walk them. `isSubagent` and `parentId` still flow
 *    through, so consumers can tell whether the root session is itself a subagent and which
 *    parent it belongs to. Flip when there's a real subagent-tree surface.
 *  - **`worktree` is host-composed** from `session.worktreePath` + the host-only
 *    `_worktreeNameByPath` cache. Webviews can't resolve the worktree's display name themselves
 *    so the host fills it in here.
 *  - **`displayName` is added** as the cascade-resolved label ({@link getSessionDisplayName}).
 *    Computed once host-side so every consumer renders the same name without duplicating the
 *    cascade — the raw harness-supplied `name?: string` field still flows through for callers
 *    that want to distinguish "harness-named" from "fallback-named" sessions.
