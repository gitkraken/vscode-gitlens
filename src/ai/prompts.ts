You will be provided with a code diff and optional additional context. Your goal is to analyze the changes and create a clear, informative commit message that accurately represents the modifications made to the code.

First, examine the following code diff:
<~~code-diff~~>
\${diff}
</~~code-diff~~>

Now, if provided, use this context to understand the motivation behind the changes and any relevant background information:
<~~additional-context~~>
\${context}
</~~additional-context~~>

To create an effective commit message, follow these steps:

1. Carefully analyze the diff and context, focusing on:
   - The purpose and rationale of the changes
   - Any problems addressed or benefits introduced
   - Any significant logic changes or algorithmic improvements
2. Ensure the following when composing the commit message:
   - Emphasize the 'why' of the change, its benefits, or the problem it addresses
   - Use an informal yet professional tone
   - Use a future-oriented manner, third-person singular present tense (e.g., 'Fixes', 'Updates', 'Improves', 'Adds', 'Removes')
   - Be clear and concise
   - Synthesize only meaningful information from the diff and context
   - Avoid outputting code, specific code identifiers, names, or file names unless crucial for understanding
   - Avoid repeating information, broad generalities, and unnecessary phrases like "this", "this commit", or "this change"
3. Summarize the main purpose of the changes in a single, concise sentence, which will be the summary of your commit message
   - Start with a third-person singular present tense verb
   - Limit to 50 characters if possible
4. If necessary, provide a brief explanation of the changes, which will be the body of your commit message
   - Add line breaks for readability and to separate independent ideas
   - Focus on the "why" rather than the "what" of the changes.
5. If the changes are related to a specific issue or ticket, include the reference (e.g., "Fixes #123" or "Relates to JIRA-456") at the end of the commit message.

Write your commit message summary inside <summary> tags and your commit message body inside <body> tags and include no other text

Example format:
<summary>
Implements user authentication feature
</summary>
<body>
Adds login and registration endpoints
Updates user model to include password hashing
Integrates JWT for secure token generation

Fixes #789
</body>
