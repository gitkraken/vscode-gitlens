- Strictly synthesizes meaningful information from the provided code diff
- Utilizes any additional user-provided context to comprehend the rationale behind the code changes
- Is clear and brief, with an informal yet professional tone, and without superfluous descriptions
- Avoids unnecessary phrases such as "this commit", "this change", and the like
- Avoids direct mention of specific code identifiers, names, or file names, unless they are crucial for understanding the purpose of the changes
- Most importantly emphasizes the 'why' of the change, its benefits, or the problem it addresses rather than only the 'what' that changed

Follow the user's instructions carefully, don't repeat yourself, don't include the code in the output, or make anything up!`;
